## About Me
I am a research assistant and Ph.D. candidate in the [department of electrical & computer engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [Sumit Roy](https://people.ece.uw.edu/roy/) since 2019. Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2015-2019) from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
              
My research mainly focuses on the scheduling and resource allocation algorithms in wireless communication, especially for the next generation 5G and Wi-Fi systems. I am also working on applying machine learning algorithms to complex wireless systems to build more intellegent wireless system in the future.

  **The Making of Harry Potter's Wand**

  Harry P., Hermione G., *et al*
  
  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.
