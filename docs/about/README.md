<AboutCard :frontmatter="$page.frontmatter" >

I am a research assistant and Ph.D. candidate in the [department of electrical & computer engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [Sumit Roy](https://people.ece.uw.edu/roy/) since 2019. Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2015-2019) from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
              
My research focuses on the scheduling and resource allocation algorithms in wireless communication, especially for the next generation 5G and Wi-Fi systems. I am also working on applying machine learning algorithms to complex wireless systems to build more intellegent wireless system in the future.
